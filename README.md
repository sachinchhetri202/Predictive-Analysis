"# Predictive-Analysis" 

 Used different algorithms to predict the survival of each individual and the age that they were at the time of the Titanic capsizing in the test dataset.

Survived Prediction
You will use the following algorithms to predict who survived and who died:
Decision tree
Neural networks
 

Age Prediction
You will use the following algorithms to predict the age (how much people paid):
Linear regression
Decision tree
Neural networks
Please report your MSE (Mean Squared Error) for each of the algorithms.
